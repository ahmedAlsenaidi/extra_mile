### COMP4206 Project

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a mobile application designed to streamline the process of booking car services and locating nearby service providers. The app aims to offer users a convenient and efficient platform to book various car services such as repairs, maintenance, and more. Key outcomes include enhancing user experience, optimizing service-customer interactions, and improving overall accessibility to automotive services.

### Current Version: Admin-Only

The current version of the application is specifically tailored for administrative use. This version allows administrators to manage and oversee various aspects of the app, ensuring smooth operation and efficient service management.

Future development will focus on expanding the application to include user functionalities, enabling customers to easily book and manage their car services through the platform.
